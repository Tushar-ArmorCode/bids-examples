# HED schema library for SCORE annotations example

In this work, we developed a HED schema library for the Standardized Computer-based Organized Reporting of EEG (SCORE). Our SCORE implementation in HED tackles the lack of SCORE machine readability and makes it available and machine-readable by open-source software.

This work is related to the (in prep) manuscript:
Tal Pal Attia et al., (in prep). "Hierarchical Event Descriptor library schema for clinical EEG data annotation".

# General information
This BIDS project provides examples of the HED SCORE implementation in several EEG and invasive EEG datasets. We included 3 subjects that have:
- Examples of Modulators.
- Examples of Seizures.
- Examples of Artifacts.
Source data are described below.

## SCORE implementation procedure
There are two ways to annotate HED in BIDS: by defining an HED column in the _events.tsv or with accompanying _events.json sidecar that lists the HED tags. We provide examples of both.
 - When annotations are specific to a particular channel, the relevant channel was annotated by including a channel column in the events.tsv file.
